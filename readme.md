Google Search Keyboard Fix
===========
It is very small `Chrome` extension that allows navigating through `Google Search` results using keyboard. For some reason this feature seems to be broken currently on many computers.

Installation
--------
Go to `Chrome` -> `Manage Extensions` -> `Load unpacked extension` and select `extension` directory from `GoogleSearchKeyboardFix`

Features
--------
For now it allows you to navigate through search results with TAB (with SHIFT) and arrows. You can focus search input by hitting escape. Basically it clones features that should be allowed to do directly on `google search` page.
